# # Problem statement:
# Suppose that we have purchased bonds of 'Apple' worth 200000 dollars and have given a committment to the company worth another 200000. We need to calculate the expected loss of this portfolio now. 
# 
# Summary:
# 
# Outstanding(Bond) = 200000 dollars <br/>
# Committment(Future) = 200000 dollars

# %% [markdown]
# ### Some background theory
# #### We know the following equation for Expected loss of a portfolio :
# Expected loss(EL) = Exposure at default(EAD) x Probability of default(PD) x Loss given default(LGD)
# 
# Hence we need to find each of the three elements EAD, PD and LGD using different models in order to calculated our EL
